TIL = Today I Learned. 

This repository contains the tips and tidbits that I use to do my work. This is a collection of  facts, how-tos, and tips that cover theoretical/numerical science, space instrument engineering, laboratory science, programming, management and more. I strive to regularly add to this repository for a few reasons, including: 

- what I write is more likely to be remembered;
- when I fail to remember, my notes are organized and easy to find
- I get to [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)

Plus, if anyone else every uses it, then I am contributing to the [daily lucky 10,000](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ten_thousand.png).

This habit of writing and sharing my work tips, storing this in GitHub, and using the name TIL are all inspired by  [Josh Branchaud](https://dev.to/jbranchaud) .
